## TIM-BOR APPLICATION PROCESS & EQUIPMENT

### How TIM-BOR Works
**Active Ingredient:** 98% Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate (DOT)  
**Mechanism:** Borate compound derived from mineral deposits containing Boron  
**Function:** Dual-action insecticide and fungicide  
**Effectiveness:** Contact toxicant to fungi, prevents metabolism of food by insects and fungi causing death  
**Protection:** Creates a protective envelope that remains for years of protection  
**Penetration:** Penetrates approximately 1/4 inch into wood surface through diffusion process  

### Application Requirements
- **Surface Preparation:** Apply only to untreated, bare wood surfaces
- **Paint/Sealers:** Must remove existing paint or sealers before application
- **Wood Condition:** Most effective on new wood or freshly exposed wood
- **Licensed Application:** Must be applied by licensed pest control operator

---

## APPLICATION METHODS & EQUIPMENT

### üî• RECOMMENDED METHOD FOR BEGINNERS: LIQUID SPRAY

**Why This Method is Easiest:**
- Simple water mixing - no special equipment needed
- Visual confirmation of coverage as you apply
- Forgiving application - spray or brush both work
- Standard equipment available at any hardware store
- Most cost-effective for first-time applicators

#### **Beginner-Friendly Mixing:**
- **Start with Standard Solution:** 1 lb TIM-BOR per gallon of water (10% solution)
- **For Heavy Fungus Damage:** 1.5 lb TIM-BOR per gallon of water (15% solution)
- **Mix in clean bucket first, then transfer to sprayer**

---

## TIM-BOR PURCHASING QUANTITIES FOR THIS PROJECT

### Project Requirements Summary
- **Total Treatment Area:** ~3,200 sq ft (all fungus damage + adjacent prevention zones)
- **TIM-BOR Solution Needed:** 22-24 gallons total
- **Coverage Rate:** 150 sq ft per gallon of mixed solution

### Purchase in 25-Pound Pails (Most Cost-Effective)
| Purchase Unit | Coverage | Project Need | Cost Est. |
|---------------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **25 lb Pail** | ~3,750 sq ft (25 gallons mixed) | **1 pail needed** | $110-120 |
| **Calculation:** | 25 lbs √∑ 1 lb per gallon √ó 150 sq ft | Covers entire project + extra | Most economical |

**Bottom Line:** **Buy 1 √ó 25 lb pail** for $110-120 - covers entire project with buffer

### Why 25 lb Pail Makes Sense:
- ‚úÖ **Covers whole project** (3,750 sq ft coverage vs. 3,200 sq ft needed)
- ‚úÖ **Cost effective** (much cheaper per pound than small packages)
- ‚úÖ **Buffer for touch-ups** (extra 500+ sq ft coverage for future needs)
- ‚úÖ **Professional quantity** (what contractors typically use)
