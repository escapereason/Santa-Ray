## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PRIORITY (FIX WITHIN 24-48 HOURS)

### 1. Kitchen Sink Leak
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Water Damage)
- **Location:** Lower unit in-law kitchen.
- **Problem:** Active leak from the sink plumbing (likely P-trap or supply lines). This is causing water damage to the cabinet and can lead to mold.
- **Scope:** Identify the source of the leak and repair it. This may involve tightening connections, replacing gaskets, or replacing the P-trap assembly.
- **Estimated Cost:** $200 - $400
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **Contractor:** Licensed Plumber.
- **DIY Potential:** Medium. If it's a simple loose connection, a homeowner with basic tools might fix it. However, if parts are corroded or cross-threaded, a plumber is needed to avoid making it worse. Given the active leak, a professional is recommended for a quick and reliable fix.

### 2. Loose Toilet
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Water Damage & Subfloor Risk)
- **Location:** Upper unit hall bathroom.
- **Problem:** The toilet is loose at its base, indicating a failed wax ring seal. Every flush can leak water onto the subfloor, leading to rot and fungus damage.
- **Scope:** The toilet must be removed, the old wax ring scraped off, the flange inspected for damage, and the toilet reset with a new wax ring and securely bolted down.
- **Estimated Cost:** $100 - $200
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **Contractor:** Licensed Plumber.
- **DIY Potential:** Medium. While a common DIY task, it's messy and physically awkward. If the flange is broken, the repair becomes much more complex. A plumber can assess the subfloor and flange condition.

## ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY (COMPLETE WITHIN 7 DAYS)

### 3. Incompatible Pipe Connection
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Location:** Subarea, below the upper unit laundry area.
- **Problem:** Galvanized steel and copper pipes are connected directly. This causes galvanic corrosion, which will eat away at the pipes and cause a leak.
- **Scope:** Install dielectric unions between the different pipe materials. This fitting isolates the metals and prevents corrosion.
- **Estimated Cost:** $200 - $400
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **Contractor:** Licensed Plumber.
- **DIY Potential:** Low. Requires cutting, fitting, and soldering/sealing pipes correctly in a potentially cramped subarea. A leak here could go unnoticed for a long time.

### 4. Improper Water Heater Relief Valve Discharge
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Location:** Upper unit water heater Temperature and Pressure (T&P) relief valve.
- **Problem:** The discharge pipe is made of an unapproved material (likely plastic) that could melt or burst under high temperature/pressure, failing to direct scalding water away safely.
- **Scope:** Replace the existing discharge pipe with an approved material (copper or CPVC) that runs to within 6 inches of the floor or to an approved indirect drain.
- **Estimated Cost:** $150 - $300
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **Contractor:** Licensed Plumber.
- **DIY Potential:** Medium. The parts are inexpensive, but this is a critical safety feature of the water heater. The pipe must be the correct diameter and routed properly to be safe and code-compliant.

### 5. Missing Water Heater Drain Pans
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Location:** Both water heaters.
- **Problem:** Neither water heater has a drain pan installed underneath it. If a slow leak develops, it will directly damage the surrounding structure.
- **Scope:** Install a code-approved drain pan under each water heater and run a drain line from the pan to the exterior of the building.
- **Estimated Cost:** $300 - $600
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **Contractor:** Licensed Plumber.
- **DIY Potential:** Low. Requires lifting the water heaters, making new plumbing connections for the drain line, and drilling through the house siding.

## ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY (OWNER ACTION)

### 6. Rusted P-Traps
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Location:** 1/2 bathroom and lower bathroom sinks.
- **Problem:** The metal P-traps under the sinks are rusted. While not leaking yet, they will eventually fail and cause water damage.
- **Scope:** Replace the deteriorated metal P-traps with new PVC or ABS plastic assemblies.
- **Estimated Cost:** Owner Referral (Parts are ~$15-30 each)
- **Recommendation:** **DIY / CONTRACTOR**
- **Contractor:** Licensed Plumber or Handyman.
- **DIY Potential:** High. This is a great entry-level plumbing task. It requires basic tools like channel-lock pliers and is a direct replacement of parts. Watch a few videos online first.
