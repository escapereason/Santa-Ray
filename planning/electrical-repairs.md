### 3. Open Electrical Subpanel Holes
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Fire & Pest Hazard)
- **Location:** Lower unit in-law closet electrical subpanel.
- **Problem:** The subpanel cover has open holes (knockouts) where breakers have been removed or were never installed. This allows sparks from a potential fault to escape the panel and ignite nearby combustible materials (e.g., clothes in the closet). It also allows pests to enter the panel.
- **Scope of Work:** A licensed electrician must install approved snap-in filler plates (blanks) in all open holes on the subpanel cover to fully seal the enclosure.
- **Required Materials:** UL-listed 1/2" or 3/4" snap-in filler plates.
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **DIY Potential:** None. Removing a panel cover is dangerous. An electrician will also inspect the panel's interior for other issues while the cover is off.

### 4. Uncovered Junction Box
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Fire & Shock Hazard)
- **Location:** Attic.
- **Problem:** A junction box containing spliced electrical wires is missing its cover. This exposes live wire connections, creating a shock hazard. Any sparks from a faulty connection can easily ignite attic insulation or other materials.
- **Scope of Work:** A licensed electrician must inspect the wiring within the box to ensure connections are secure, then install a code-compliant cover plate to fully enclose the box.
- **Required Materials:** One 4-inch square or octagonal junction box cover plate.
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **DIY Potential:** None. Working in an attic with potentially old wiring is a job for a professional.

### 5. Loose Subpanel Wiring
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Fire Hazard)
- **Location:** Upper unit electrical subpanel.
- **Problem:** Wires entering the subpanel are not secured with proper connectors (clamps). Over time, vibrations or accidental contact can cause the wires to pull away from the breakers, creating loose connections that arc and cause a fire. The sharp metal edge of the panel can also chafe the wire insulation.
- **Scope of Work:** A licensed electrician must install approved connector clamps in the panel knockouts for all unsecured cables. This involves de-energizing circuits, carefully repositioning the cables, and tightening the clamps to secure them.
- **Required Materials:** 3/8 inch (or appropriately sized) cable connectors for non-metallic (NM) or armored cable (AC/MC).
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **DIY Potential:** None. This involves working inside a main electrical panel, which is extremely dangerous.

### 6. Exposed Unprotected Wiring
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Fire & Shock Hazard)
- **Locations:** 
    - Utility room, lower floor.
    - Stairwell.
- **Problem:** Standard NM (non-metallic) electrical wire is exposed where it is subject to physical damage. This type of wire is not designed to be run on the surface of walls in high-traffic or utility areas. Damage to the wire's outer sheath can expose the inner conductors, leading to shock or fire.
- **Scope of Work:** A licensed electrician must remove the exposed NM wire and replace it with a wiring method approved for physical protection, such as BX/MC (armored cable) or running the wire inside EMT (electrical metallic tubing).
- **Required Materials:** 12/2 or 14/2 BX/MC armored cable, or appropriate gauge THHN wire and EMT conduit.
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **DIY Potential:** None. This requires knowledge of code-compliant wiring methods and proper installation techniques.

### 7. Faulty GFCI Outlets
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Shock Hazard)
- **Locations:** 
    - Lower unit kitchen.
    - Rear exterior outlet.
- **Problem:** The GFCI outlets in these wet locations fail to trip when tested, offering no protection against electrocution.
- **Recommendation:** **DIY**
- **DIY Potential:** Medium. This is slightly more complex than a standard receptacle due to the LINE/LOAD terminals, but is very achievable with careful work.

#### **DIY Guide: Replacing a GFCI Receptacle**

**Tools & Materials:**
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Voltage Tester (Non-Contact):** Absolutely essential for safety.
    *   Screwdriver (Flat-head and Phillips).
    *   Wire Stripper/Cutter.
    *   Needle-Nose Pliers.
*   **Materials:**
    *   One (1) 15A or 20A Tamper-Resistant (TR) GFCI Receptacle.
    *   For the exterior outlet, ensure it is a **Weather-Resistant (WR)** GFCI.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY FIRST: Turn Off Power:**
    *   Go to your electrical panel and turn off the correct breaker.
    *   **VERIFY POWER IS OFF:** Use your non-contact voltage tester on the old GFCI outlet to ensure it has no power.

2.  **Remove Old GFCI:**
    *   Unscrew and remove the cover plate and the GFCI receptacle from the wall box.

3.  **Identify LINE vs. LOAD wires:**
    *   **This is the most important step.** A GFCI has two sets of terminals:
        *   **LINE:** For the wires bringing power **FROM** the breaker.
        *   **LOAD:** For wires that carry power **TO** other outlets downstream.
    *   Look closely at the back of the old GFCI. The terminals should be marked. Note which wires go to LINE and which go to LOAD. Take a picture with your phone.
    *   **If there is only one set of wires (one black, one white), they will connect to the LINE terminals.**

4.  **Disconnect and Connect New GFCI:**
    *   Disconnect the wires from the old outlet.
    *   Connect the wires to the new GFCI, matching the previous configuration:
        *   **LINE wires (from panel)** go to the **LINE terminals** (Black to Brass, White to Silver).
        *   **LOAD wires (to other outlets)** go to the **LOAD terminals**.
    *   The new GFCI will have a sticker covering the LOAD terminals. Only remove it if you have LOAD wires to connect.
    *   Connect the bare copper ground wire to the green screw.

5.  **Install and Finish:**
    *   Carefully push the wires and the new GFCI back into the box. GFCIs are bulky, so this may be a tight fit.
    -   Screw the GFCI into the box and install the cover plate.

6.  **Final Test:**
    *   Turn the breaker back on. The GFCI should have a green light.
    *   Press the **"TEST"** button. The outlet should click and the green light should go out. This means it has successfully interrupted the power.
    *   Press the **"RESET"** button. The outlet should click again and the green light should come back on.
    *   If this test works, your GFCI is installed correctly and providing protection.
