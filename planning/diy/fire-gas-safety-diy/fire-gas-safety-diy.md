## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PRIORITY

### 1. Missing Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detectors
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Life Safety Hazard)
- **Locations:** Lower unit and in-law apartment
- **Problem:** There are no CO detectors installed in units with fuel-burning appliances (furnace, water heater, stove). CO is an odorless, colorless gas that can be lethal. California law requires CO detectors in all dwelling units.
- **Difficulty:** Easy - One of the most important and easiest safety upgrades
- **Legal Requirement:** Required by California law

#### **DIY Guide: Installing CO Detectors**

**What to Look For:**

*   **Type:** For simplicity and reliability, use **10-year sealed battery** CO detectors. This means no low-battery chirps for a decade. Combination smoke and CO detectors are also a great choice to upgrade safety.
*   **Placement is Key:** CO mixes with air, so detectors can be placed at various heights. The manufacturer's instructions are your primary guide, but here are the code requirements:
    *   **Outside Sleeping Areas:** Install a detector in the hallway or area directly outside of bedrooms.
    *   **On Every Level:** At least one detector on each floor of the home, including basements.
*   **Avoid:**
    *   **Garages, kitchens, and bathrooms:** Steam, humidity, and cooking fumes can cause false alarms. Keep detectors at least 15 feet away from cooking appliances.
    *   **Direct Sunlight or Near Heating Vents:** Avoid areas with turbulent air or temperature fluctuations.
    *   **Behind Furniture or Curtains:** The detector must have clear air access.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Choose Your Locations:** Identify the best spots in the lower unit and the in-law apartment based on the guidelines above.
2.  **Unpack and Activate:** Remove the detector from the packaging. Most 10-year models are activated by twisting them onto their mounting plate or pulling a tab. It should beep or have a light to confirm it's on.
3.  **Mount the Plate:**
    *   Hold the mounting plate against the wall or ceiling in your chosen location.
    *   Use a pencil to mark the screw holes.
    *   Use a drill or screwdriver to install the included screws and anchors.
4.  **Attach the Detector:** Twist the CO detector onto the mounting plate until it clicks into place.
5.  **Test the Unit:** Press the "Test" button on the detector. It should sound a loud alarm. This confirms the unit is working correctly. Test your detectors monthly.

#### **Installation Locations for This Property:**

**Lower Unit:**
- **Primary location:** Hallway outside bedrooms
- **Secondary location:** Near furnace/water heater area (but not too close to avoid false alarms)

**In-Law Apartment:**
- **Primary location:** Main living area or near sleeping area
- **Near kitchen area:** At least 15 feet from cooking appliances

#### **Recommended Products:**

**Basic Option:**
- **First Alert 10-Year CO Detector** - $15-20 each
- **Kidde 10-Year Sealed Battery CO Detector** - $15-25 each

**Premium Option:**
- **First Alert Combination Smoke/CO Detector** - $25-35 each
- **Nest Protect (Smart Smoke/CO)** - $100+ each (if smart home integration desired)

**Budget Consideration:** For basic safety compliance, the $15-20 units are perfectly adequate and meet all code requirements.

## CARBON MONOXIDE SAFETY EDUCATION

### What is Carbon Monoxide?
- **Colorless, odorless gas** produced by incomplete combustion
- **Common sources:** Furnaces, water heaters, stoves, fireplaces, cars
- **How it harms:** Replaces oxygen in bloodstream, causing poisoning
- **Silent killer:** Victims often don't realize they're being poisoned

### Symptoms of CO Poisoning
**Mild exposure:**
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Weakness
- Upset stomach
- Chest pain
- Confusion

**Severe exposure:**
- Vomiting
- Loss of coordination
- Loss of consciousness
- Death

### What to Do if CO Detector Alarms
1. **Get everyone outside immediately** to fresh air
2. **Call 911** from outside the building
3. **Do NOT re-enter** until emergency responders clear the building
4. **Seek medical attention** even if feeling fine
5. **Have gas appliances inspected** before using again
