This is a protective channel that adheres to the wall and can be painted.

**Tools & Materials:**
*   **Tools:**
    *   Tape Measure
    *   Hacksaw or miter saw for cutting the raceway
    *   Level
*   **Materials:**
    *   Surface-mounted raceway kit (e.g., Legrand Wiremold or similar). Get a kit that includes the channel, corner pieces, and any other fittings you need.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY FIRST: Turn Off Power:** Turn off the breaker for this circuit and verify with a voltage tester.
2.  **Plan Your Route:** Measure the path the wire will take. Plan where you'll place the straight channels and corner pieces.
3.  **Cut the Raceway:** Cut the raceway channels to the lengths you measured. Use a hacksaw for a clean cut.
4.  **Mount the Base:** The raceway has a backing and a cover. Remove the adhesive backing from the base piece and press it firmly onto the wall along your planned route. Use a level to ensure it's straight.
5.  **Place the Wire:** Carefully lay the existing electrical wire inside the channel of the base.
6.  **Install Fittings and Cover:** Snap on any corner pieces or other fittings. Then, snap the main cover piece over the base, enclosing the wire.
7.  **Turn Power On:** Once everything is secure, you can restore power.

**Option 2: Electrical Metallic Tubing (EMT Conduit)**

This provides robust metal protection. It's a bit more work but is the professional standard.

**Tools & Materials:**
*   **Tools:**
    *   Tape Measure
    *   Hacksaw or tubing cutter
    *   Conduit bender (if you need to make bends)
    *   Screwdriver
*   **Materials:**
    *   1/2-inch EMT conduit
    *   EMT connectors (to connect to electrical boxes)
    *   EMT straps (to secure the conduit to the wall)

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY FIRST: Turn Off Power:** Turn off the breaker and verify with a voltage tester.
2.  **Plan and Measure:** Measure the run and determine where you need to secure the conduit.
3.  **Cut and Bend Conduit:** Cut the conduit to length with a hacksaw or tubing cutter. If you need to go around corners, you will need to use a conduit bender to make smooth bends. Alternatively, you can use corner fittings (elbows).
4.  **Feed the Wire:** Carefully feed the existing wire through the cut pieces of conduit.
5.  **Assemble and Secure:**
    *   Connect the conduit sections to the electrical boxes at each end using EMT connectors.
    *   Secure the conduit to the wall every few feet using EMT straps and screws.

    - Lower unit kitchen.
    - Rear exterior outlet.
- **Problem:** The GFCI outlets in these wet locations fail to trip when tested, offering no protection against electrocution.
- **Difficulty:** Medium - Slightly more complex than standard receptacle due to LINE/LOAD terminals

---
#### **DIY Guide: Replacing a GFCI Receptacle**

**Tools & Materials:**
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Voltage Tester (Non-Contact):** Absolutely essential for safety.
    *   Screwdriver (Flat-head and Phillips).
    *   Wire Stripper/Cutter.
    *   Needle-Nose Pliers.
*   **Materials:**
    *   One (1) 15A or 20A Tamper-Resistant (TR) GFCI Receptacle.
    *   For the exterior outlet, ensure it is a **Weather-Resistant (WR)** GFCI.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY FIRST: Turn Off Power:**
    *   Go to your electrical panel and turn off the correct breaker.
    *   **VERIFY POWER IS OFF:** Use your non-contact voltage tester on the old GFCI outlet to ensure it has no power.

2.  **Remove Old GFCI:**
    *   Unscrew and remove the cover plate and the GFCI receptacle from the wall box.

3.  **Identify LINE vs. LOAD wires:**
    *   **This is the most important step.** A GFCI has two sets of terminals:
        *   **LINE:** For the wires bringing power **FROM** the breaker.
        *   **LOAD:** For wires that carry power **TO** other outlets downstream.
    *   Look closely at the back of the old GFCI. The terminals should be marked. Note which wires go to LINE and which go to LOAD. Take a picture with your phone.
    *   **If there is only one set of wires (one black, one white), they will connect to the LINE terminals.**

4.  **Disconnect and Connect New GFCI:**
    *   Disconnect the wires from the old outlet.
    *   Connect the wires to the new GFCI, matching the previous configuration:
        *   **LINE wires (from panel)** go to the **LINE terminals** (Black to Brass, White to Silver).
        *   **LOAD wires (to other outlets)** go to the **LOAD terminals**.
    *   The new GFCI will have a sticker covering the LOAD terminals. Only remove it if you have LOAD wires to connect.
    *   Connect the bare copper ground wire to the green screw.

5.  **Install and Finish:**
    *   Carefully push the wires and the new GFCI back into the box. GFCIs are bulky, so this may be a tight fit.
    -   Screw the GFCI into the box and install the cover plate.

6.  **Final Test:**
    *   Turn the breaker back on. The GFCI should have a green light.
    *   Press the **"TEST"** button. The outlet should click and the green light should go out. This means it has successfully interrupted the power.
    *   Press the **"RESET"** button. The outlet should click again and the green light should come back on.
    *   If this test works, your GFCI is installed correctly and providing protection.
