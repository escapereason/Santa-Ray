## ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY

### 1. Rusted P-Traps
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (Preventive Maintenance)
- **Location:** 1/2 bathroom and lower bathroom sinks
- **Problem:** The metal P-traps under the sinks are rusted. While not leaking yet, they will eventually fail and cause water damage.
- **Difficulty:** Easy - Great entry-level plumbing project

#### **DIY Guide: Replacing P-Traps**

**Why This is Perfect for DIY:**
- No special licensing required
- Standard parts available at any hardware store
- Direct replacement with common tools
- Immediate visual feedback if something is wrong (leaks are obvious)
- Very difficult to create a dangerous situation

**Tools & Materials:**
*   **Tools:**
    *   Channel-lock pliers (adjustable wrench)
    *   Bucket or container for water
    *   Old towels or rags
    *   Flashlight
*   **Materials:**
    *   PVC or ABS plastic P-trap assembly (1 1/4" or 1 1/2" - measure existing)
    *   Plumber's putty or pipe thread compound (if needed)
    *   Rubber slip-joint washers (usually included with P-trap kit)

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Preparation:**
    *   Turn off water supply to the sink (not strictly necessary but good practice)
    *   Clear everything from under the sink cabinet
    *   Place bucket under the existing P-trap to catch water
    *   Take a photo of the existing configuration with your phone

2.  **Remove Old P-Trap:**
    *   **Loosen slip nuts:** Use channel-lock pliers to loosen the slip nuts (threaded connectors) on both ends of the P-trap. Turn counterclockwise.
    *   **Expect water:** Water will spill out - this is normal. Let it drain into your bucket.
    *   **Remove trap:** Once both slip nuts are loose, pull the old P-trap straight down and out.

3.  **Clean and Inspect:**
    *   Clean the threaded areas on the sink drain and wall drain pipe
    *   Check that the rubber washers/gaskets in the slip nuts are in good condition
    *   Inspect the sink drain and wall pipe for any damage

4.  **Install New P-Trap:**
    *   **Dry fit first:** Before tightening anything, put the new P-trap in place to ensure everything aligns properly
    *   **Install washers:** Make sure rubber washers are properly seated in the slip nuts
    *   **Connect to sink drain:** Slide the slip nut and washer over the sink drain, then push the P-trap up into position
    *   **Connect to wall drain:** Align the other end with the wall drain pipe
    *   **Hand tighten:** Start by hand-tightening both slip nuts

5.  **Secure and Test:**
    *   **Tighten with pliers:** Use channel-lock pliers to snug up the slip nuts. **Don't over-tighten** - just firm resistance.
    *   **Test for leaks:** Turn water back on and run water in the sink for 2-3 minutes
    *   **Check under sink:** Look for any drips. If you see water, slightly tighten the leaking connection.

6.  **Final Check:**
    *   Run water several times throughout the day and check for leaks
    *   Ensure the trap maintains its water seal (you should see water in the curved part)

#### **Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

**Problem: P-trap doesn't align properly**
- **Solution:** P-traps are adjustable. The curved section can slide in and out, and there are angled fittings if needed.

**Problem: Slow drip from slip nuts**
- **Solution:** Slightly tighten the connection. If it persists, check that the rubber washer is properly seated.

**Problem: Existing drain pipes are damaged**
- **Solution:** Stop and call a plumber. This indicates a larger issue that may require opening walls.

#### **When to Stop and Call a Professional:**
- **Corroded or damaged drain pipes** in the wall
- **Misaligned plumbing** that can't be adjusted with new P-trap
- **Multiple leaks** after proper installation
- **Strange odors** coming from drains (may indicate venting issues)
