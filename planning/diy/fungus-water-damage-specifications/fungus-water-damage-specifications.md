**Mechanism:** Borate compound derived from mineral deposits containing Boron  
**Function:** Dual-action insecticide and fungicide  
**Effectiveness:** Contact toxicant to fungi, prevents metabolism of food by insects and fungi causing death  
**Protection:** Creates a protective envelope that remains for years of protection  
**Penetration:** Penetrates approximately 1/4 inch into wood surface through diffusion process  

### Application Requirements
- **Surface Preparation:** Apply only to untreated, bare wood surfaces
- **Paint/Sealers:** Must remove existing paint or sealers before application
- **Wood Condition:** Most effective on new wood or freshly exposed wood
- **Licensed Application:** Must be applied by licensed pest control operator

## APPLICATION METHODS & EQUIPMENT

### üî• RECOMMENDED METHOD FOR BEGINNERS: LIQUID SPRAY

**Why This Method is Easiest:**
- Simple water mixing - no special equipment needed
- Visual confirmation of coverage as you apply
- Forgiving application - spray or brush both work
- Standard equipment available at any hardware store
- Most cost-effective for first-time applicators

#### **Beginner-Friendly Mixing:**
- **Start with Standard Solution:** 1 lb TIM-BOR per gallon of water (10% solution)
- **For Heavy Fungus Damage:** 1.5 lb TIM-BOR per gallon of water (15% solution)
- **Mix in clean bucket first, then transfer to sprayer**

## WOOD BILL OF MATERIALS

### **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**
**These quantities are estimates based on pest inspection findings. Contractors MUST verify all dimensions and quantities through on-site measurement before ordering materials. Final quantities may vary significantly based on actual conditions found during demolition.**

### **Notes on Material Selection (Home Depot Focus)**
*   **Pressure-Treated (PT) Lumber:** The original spec called for PT Douglas Fir. This has been updated to **PT Southern Yellow Pine (SYP)**, which is the common and strong species available at most Home Depot stores.
*   **Treatment Level:** All PT lumber specified is **"Ground Contact"**. This provides superior protection against moisture and rot, which is critical for this project. It is a necessary upgrade.
*   **Appearance Wood:** The original spec called for "Clear Douglas Fir" for windows, doors, and railings. This is a specialty item. This BOM substitutes it with two options:
    *   **Select Pine / Poplar:** For paint-grade items like window and door parts. This is the highest grade available at Home Depot, with minimal knots.
    *   **Cedar / Redwood:** For stain-grade or high-exposure items like handrails. These woods have natural rot resistance and are readily available.
*   **Grade:** For all structural lumber (e.g., 2x4, 2x6), look for a **#2 grade stamp** on the wood itself in the store. This is the standard for residential construction.
