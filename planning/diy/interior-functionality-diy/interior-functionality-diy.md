## 游릭 MEDIUM PRIORITY

### 1. Drywall Patching & Repair
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (Cosmetic & Foundational for Painting)
- **Locations:** Various rooms with cracks, holes, or water stains.
- **Problem:** Minor wall imperfections detract from the home's appearance and must be fixed before painting.
- **Difficulty:** Medium - Requires patience for a smooth finish.

---
#### **DIY Guide: Patching Drywall**

**Tools & Materials:**
*   **Tools:** Putty knife (2-inch and 6-inch), sanding block, utility knife.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Drywall patch kit (for small holes).
    *   Spackle or lightweight joint compound.
    *   Fine-grit sandpaper (120-220 grit).
    *   Primer.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Preparation:** Clean the area around the hole or crack, removing any loose debris. For larger holes, cut a clean square around the damage.
2.  **Apply Patch:** For small holes, apply spackle directly. For larger holes, use a self-adhesive mesh patch or a new piece of drywall.
3.  **First Coat:** Use a putty knife to apply a thin layer of joint compound over the patch, feathering the edges outward.
4.  **Sand:** Once completely dry, lightly sand the area until it is smooth and flush with the wall.
5.  **Second Coat (if needed):** Apply a second, wider coat, feathering even further. Let dry and sand again.
6.  **Prime:** Apply a coat of primer over the repaired area to seal it before painting. This prevents the patch from "flashing" (appearing different) through the topcoat of paint.

- **Location:** Various Rooms

- **Difficulty:** Easy - Tedious but simple.

---
#### **DIY Guide: Prepping for a Professional Paint Job**

**Tools & Materials:**
*   **Tools:** Screwdrivers, sponges, buckets.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Painter's tape (high quality, e.g., FrogTape or 3M Blue).
    *   Drop cloths (canvas is better than plastic).
    *   TSP (Trisodium Phosphate) or a good wall cleaner.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Clear the Room:** Move all furniture to the center of the room and cover it, or remove it completely.
2.  **Clean the Walls:** Wipe down all walls with a TSP solution or a damp sponge to remove dust, grease, and grime. This is critical for paint adhesion.
3.  **Tape Off Trim:** Apply painter's tape carefully along the top of baseboards, around window and door trim, and at the ceiling line. Press the edge down firmly to prevent bleeding.
4.  **Remove Hardware:** Remove all outlet covers, switch plates, and any wall-mounted light fixtures. Keep screws with their plates.

## 游리 HIGH PRIORITY

### 5. New Door Installation (Large Corner Bedroom)
- **Priority:** HIGH (Major functionality change)
- **Location:** Large Corner Bedroom
- **Problem:** The current layout may be improved by adding a new door for better access or privacy.
- **Difficulty:** Advanced - Involves framing, drywall, and structural considerations.

---
#### **DIY Guide: Installing a Pre-Hung Interior Door**

**丘멆잺 SAFETY WARNING**: This is a structural change. Before cutting, you **MUST** check the wall for electrical wires, plumbing pipes, and HVAC ducts. Use a stud finder that can detect live AC voltage. If this wall is load-bearing, you must build a temporary support wall before starting. If you are unsure, stop and consult a professional contractor.

**Tools & Materials:**
*   **Tools:**
    *   Tape Measure & Level (4-foot recommended)
    *   Stud Finder
    *   Reciprocating Saw & Drywall Saw
    *   Circular Saw or Miter Saw
    *   Drill/Driver with bits
    *   Hammer & Nail Set
    *   Pry Bar
*   **Materials:**
    *   Pre-hung interior door (sized for your needs)
    *   2x4 lumber for framing (king studs, jack studs, header)
    *   Wood shims (composite is best)
    *   3-inch construction screws or framing nails
    *   Finish nails (for trim)
    *   Drywall, tape, and joint compound for patching
    *   Door casing/trim and doorknob hardware

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Plan and Mark the Opening:**
    *   Decide on the exact location of the door.
    *   The **Rough Opening** needs to be 2 inches wider and 2.5 inches taller than the door itself. (e.g., a 30"x80" door needs a 32"x82.5" rough opening).
    *   Use a stud finder to locate the existing studs. Plan to use one existing stud as a king stud if possible.
    *   Mark the full rough opening on both sides of the wall.

2.  **Expose the Wall Cavity:**
    *   **Check for Utilities:** Drill a small exploratory hole and use a flashlight or snake camera to visually inspect for wires or pipes. **TURN OFF POWER** to the area as a precaution.
    *   Cut and remove the drywall along your markings for the rough opening.

3.  **Frame the Rough Opening:**
    *   **King Studs:** These run from the floor's bottom plate to the ceiling's top plate on the outer edges of your opening.
    *   **Jack Studs (Trimmer Studs):** Cut these to the height of your rough opening (e.g., 82.5"). Nail them to the inside of the king studs. They will support the header.
    *   **Header:** Cut two pieces of 2x4 to the width between your king studs. Sandwich a 1/2-inch piece of plywood or OSB between them to make a strong header. Rest this header on top of the jack studs.
    *   **Cripple Studs:** Install short studs between the header and the top plate to provide support for the drywall.

4.  **Install the Pre-Hung Door:**
    *   Remove the shipping brace and any packaging from the pre-hung door.
    *   Place the door into the rough opening. Push the hinge-side jamb tight against the jack stud.

5.  **Shim and Secure:**
    *   **Hinge Side First:** Using your level, ensure the hinge-side jamb is perfectly plumb (vertically level). Insert shims in pairs (one from each side) behind each hinge and at the top and bottom.
    *   Secure the hinge-side jamb by nailing or screwing through the jamb and shims into the framing.
    *   **Latch Side:** Move to the latch side. Shim behind the latch plate location and at the top and bottom. Adjust the shims until the gap between the door and the jamb is consistent all the way around (about the width of a nickel).
    *   Secure the latch-side jamb through the shims.

6.  **Finish and Trim:**
    *   Score and snap off the excess shims.
    *   Install the door casing (trim) around the door frame using finish nails.
    *   Install the doorknob and strike plate.
    *   Patch the drywall, then prime and paint the new wall and trim.
