## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PRIORITY (IMMEDIATE FIX)

### 1. Crushed Dryer Vent
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Fire Hazard)
- **Location:** Lower unit in-law apartment.
- **Problem:** The flexible dryer vent hose is crushed. This restricts airflow, creating a serious fire hazard and causing the dryer to operate inefficiently.
- **Estimated Cost:** $20 - $40 (for materials)
- **Recommendation:** **DIY**

#### **DIY Guide: Replacing the Dryer Vent Duct**

This is a critical safety repair. Do not skip any steps. The goal is to create a secure, unobstructed path for hot, moist, lint-filled air to exit your home.

#### **Part 1: Tools & Materials**

**Materials:**
*   **Dryer Duct:** One 4-inch diameter **UL 2158A listed semi-rigid aluminum duct**. This is the safest and most durable option. Avoid flimsy foil or vinyl ducts, as they are more prone to crushing and can catch fire. A standard 8-foot length is usually sufficient.
*   **Clamps:** Two 4-inch metal worm-drive clamps. These are more secure than spring clamps.

**Tools:**
*   **Screwdriver or Nut Driver:** To tighten the clamps.
*   **Pliers:** For general use.
*   **Tape Measure:** To ensure you have the correct length.
*   **Work Gloves:** To protect your hands from sharp metal edges.
*   **Dust Mask:** To avoid inhaling lint and dust.
*   **Vacuum Cleaner:** With a hose and brush attachment for cleanup.

#### **Part 2: Step-by-Step Instructions**

1.  **Safety First:**
    *   Unplug the dryer from the electrical outlet.
    *   If you have a gas dryer, **be extremely careful not to disturb the flexible gas line**. If it seems old or brittle, stop and call a professional.

2.  **Access the Dryer:**
    *   Carefully pull the dryer straight out from the wall. Give yourself enough room to comfortably work behind it.

3.  **Remove the Old Duct:**
    *   Use your screwdriver or pliers to loosen the clamps holding the old duct to the dryer's exhaust port and the vent pipe on the wall.
    *   Pull the old, crushed duct off both ends and dispose of it.

4.  **Thoroughly Clean All Points:**
    *   This is a critical step for fire prevention.
    *   Use your vacuum to clean all lint from the **dryer's exhaust port**.
    *   Clean the **entire length of the vent pipe inside the wall** as far as you can reach.
    *   Go outside and clean the **exterior vent hood**, ensuring the flap or louvers can move freely.

5.  **Prepare the New Duct:**
    *   Extend the new semi-rigid duct. Keep it as short and straight as possible for the best airflow. Try not to make any sharp 90-degree bends; gentle curves are better.
    *   Place a metal clamp over each end of the new duct before you attach it.

6.  **Attach the Duct:**
    *   **Dryer Side:** Fit one end of the duct over the dryer's exhaust port. Slide the clamp into position over the connection and tighten it securely. The connection should be snug and airtight.
    *   **Wall Side:** Fit the other end of the duct over the wall vent pipe. Tighten the second clamp securely.

7.  **Inspect Your Work:**
    *   Gently tug on both ends of the duct to ensure they are firmly attached.
    *   Check the entire length of the duct to make sure it is **not kinked, crushed, or sagging**.

8.  **Position the Dryer & Final Check:**
    *   Carefully push the dryer back into its place. **Do this slowly and check behind the unit as you go to ensure you are not crushing the new duct.** This is the most common mistake. Leave a few inches of space between the dryer and the wall.
    *   Plug the dryer back in.
    *   Run the dryer on a no-heat/air-fluff cycle for 5-10 minutes.
    *   **Final Confirmation:** Go outside and check the exterior vent. You should feel a strong, steady stream of air. If not, the duct is likely blocked or kinked.

## ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY (COMPLETE WITHIN 7 DAYS)

### 2. Furnace Condensation Leak
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Location:** Lower unit in-law furnace vent.
- **Problem:** The high-efficiency furnace produces condensation, and the vent connection is leaking. This has caused corrosion and can lead to water damage and furnace malfunction.
- **Scope:** A licensed HVAC technician needs to disassemble, clean, and properly reseal the vent pipe connection. Any corroded parts should be replaced.
- **Estimated Cost:** $300 - $600
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **Contractor:** Licensed HVAC Contractor.
- **DIY Potential:** None. This involves the furnace's exhaust system, which handles corrosive materials. Incorrect repair can lead to dangerous flue gas leaks or further damage.

### 3. Noisy Furnace Fan
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Location:** Lower unit furnace inducer motor.
- **Problem:** The furnace's inducer motor is excessively noisy, which typically indicates failing bearings or a damaged fan housing. If it fails, the furnace will not operate.
- **Scope:** Repair or replace the inducer motor assembly. The technician will diagnose whether the motor can be repaired or if a full replacement is more cost-effective.
- **Estimated Cost:** $400 - $800
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **Contractor:** Licensed HVAC Contractor.
- **DIY Potential:** None. This is a critical component of the furnace. Mishandling can damage the furnace control board or the component itself.

### 4. Missing Attic Ventilation
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Location:** Attic space.
- **Problem:** The attic lacks proper ventilation. This traps heat in the summer and moisture in the winter, which can lead to premature roof aging, mold growth, and reduced energy efficiency.
- **Scope:** Install a sufficient number of attic vents (e.g., soffit, ridge, or gable vents) to create proper airflow according to building codes.
- **Estimated Cost:** $500 - $1,000
- **Recommendation:** **CONTRACTOR**
- **Contractor:** Licensed Roofer or General Contractor.
- **DIY Potential:** Medium. Requires working in the attic and potentially on the roof. Cutting into the roof or soffits carries a high risk of causing leaks if not done correctly.
