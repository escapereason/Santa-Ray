## 游리 HIGH PRIORITY

### 1. Furnace Condensation Leak
- **Priority:** HIGH (Equipment Protection)
- **Location:** Lower unit in-law furnace vent
- **Problem:** The high-efficiency furnace produces condensation, and the vent connection is leaking. This has caused corrosion and can lead to water damage and furnace malfunction.
- **Estimated Cost:** $300 - $600

#### **Scope of Work:**
- **Complete system inspection** of condensate drainage system
- **Disassemble vent connection** to assess corrosion damage
- **Clean and seal all vent pipe connections** with appropriate materials
- **Replace corroded components** (vent pipe sections, fittings, gaskets)
- **Test condensate drainage** under full operation
- **Verify proper slope** of condensate lines
- **Check condensate pump** operation if equipped
- **Pressure test** vent system for additional leaks

#### **Potential Repair Scenarios:**
- **Simple seal repair:** Clean and reseal connections - $300-400
- **Partial component replacement:** Vent sections or fittings - $400-500
- **Extensive repair:** Multiple components and drainage system - $500-600

#### **Required Materials:**
- **High-temperature vent pipe** (PVC/CPVC rated for condensing furnaces)
- **Vent pipe fittings** and couplings
- **High-temperature sealants** approved for HVAC applications
- **Condensate drainage components** as needed

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- **Furnace exhaust systems** handle corrosive condensate and flue gases
- **Improper repair** can lead to dangerous gas leaks or carbon monoxide exposure
- **Specialized knowledge** of condensing furnace requirements
- **Code compliance** for venting and drainage systems
- **Warranty preservation** for furnace equipment

### 2. Noisy Furnace Fan (Inducer Motor)
- **Priority:** HIGH (Equipment Failure Prevention)
- **Location:** Lower unit furnace inducer motor
- **Problem:** The furnace's inducer motor is excessively noisy, which typically indicates failing bearings or a damaged fan housing. If it fails, the furnace will not operate.
- **Estimated Cost:** $400 - $800

#### **Scope of Work:**
- **Diagnostic testing** of inducer motor operation and performance
- **Disassemble and inspect** motor bearings and fan assembly
- **Determine repair vs. replacement** based on component condition
- **Replace inducer motor assembly** if beyond repair
- **Calibrate and test** new motor with furnace control system
- **Verify proper airflow** and pressure relationships
- **Update maintenance records** and provide operation manual

#### **Repair vs. Replacement Decision Factors:**
- **Motor age and model** availability of parts
- **Bearing condition** - rebuildable vs. replacement required
- **Control board compatibility** with new motor specifications
- **Cost-effectiveness** of repair vs. full replacement
- **Warranty coverage** on new vs. repaired components

#### **Required Components:**
- **Inducer motor assembly** (OEM or approved equivalent)
- **Motor mounting hardware** and gaskets
- **Electrical connections** and wire nuts
- **Control system programming** if required

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- **Critical furnace component** affecting safety and operation
- **Gas furnace safety systems** require precise calibration
- **Electrical connections** to furnace control board
- **Warranty requirements** for furnace manufacturer coverage
- **Combustion air calculations** must be maintained
- **Carbon monoxide testing** required after repair

### 3. Missing Attic Ventilation
- **Priority:** HIGH (Building Performance)
- **Location:** Attic space throughout building
- **Problem:** The attic lacks proper ventilation. This traps heat in the summer and moisture in the winter, which can lead to premature roof aging, mold growth, and reduced energy efficiency.
- **Estimated Cost:** $500 - $1,000

#### **Scope of Work:**
- **Calculate ventilation requirements** based on attic square footage
- **Assess existing ventilation** and identify deficiencies
- **Design balanced ventilation system** (intake and exhaust)
- **Install appropriate vent types** based on roof configuration:
  - **Soffit vents** for intake air
  - **Ridge vents** for continuous exhaust
  - **Gable vents** if ridge vents not feasible
  - **Turbine or powered vents** for enhanced exhaust
- **Ensure proper air flow patterns** from soffit to ridge
- **Seal air leaks** between conditioned space and attic
- **Install baffles** to maintain soffit vent clearance

#### **Ventilation Calculation:**
- **Standard requirement:** 1 sq ft of vent area per 150 sq ft of attic space
- **Balanced system:** 50% intake (soffit) + 50% exhaust (ridge/gable)
- **Enhanced performance:** May exceed minimum requirements for optimal results

#### **Installation Considerations:**
- **Roof penetrations** must be properly waterproofed
- **Structural integrity** maintained during installation
- **Existing insulation** may need repositioning
- **Electrical coordination** if powered vents are used

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- **Roof work safety** requires proper equipment and experience
- **Waterproofing expertise** critical to prevent leaks
- **Structural knowledge** for safe roof penetrations
- **Building code compliance** for ventilation requirements
- **Coordination with roofer** if extensive roof work needed
- **Potential permits required** for structural modifications
