## üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY

### 1. Open Electrical Subpanel Holes
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Fire & Pest Hazard)
- **Location:** Lower unit in-law closet electrical subpanel
- **Problem:** The subpanel cover has open holes (knockouts) where breakers have been removed or were never installed. This allows sparks from a potential fault to escape the panel and ignite nearby combustible materials (e.g., clothes in the closet). It also allows pests to enter the panel.
- **Estimated Cost:** $100 - $150

#### **Scope of Work:**
- Licensed electrician must install approved snap-in filler plates (blanks) in all open holes on the subpanel cover
- Full panel inspection while cover is removed
- Verify all existing breakers are properly seated and labeled
- Ensure panel cover is properly secured

#### **Required Materials:**
- UL-listed 1/2" or 3/4" snap-in filler plates
- Panel cover gasket if damaged

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- Removing panel covers exposes live electrical components
- Risk of arc flash and electrocution
- Opportunity to inspect panel interior for other code violations
- Proper selection and installation of UL-listed components

### 2. Loose Subpanel Wiring
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Fire Hazard)
- **Location:** Upper unit electrical subpanel
- **Problem:** Wires entering the subpanel are not secured with proper connectors (clamps). Over time, vibrations or accidental contact can cause the wires to pull away from the breakers, creating loose connections that arc and cause a fire. The sharp metal edge of the panel can also chafe the wire insulation.
- **Estimated Cost:** $150 - $250

#### **Scope of Work:**
- De-energize affected circuits safely
- Install approved connector clamps in panel knockouts for all unsecured cables
- Carefully reposition cables to prevent strain on connections
- Tighten all clamps to manufacturer specifications
- Test all affected circuits for proper operation
- Update electrical panel labeling if necessary

#### **Required Materials:**
- 3/8 inch (or appropriately sized) cable connectors for non-metallic (NM) or armored cable (AC/MC)
- Locknut connectors as required
- Panel schedule labels

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- Work inside live electrical panels is extremely dangerous
- Requires understanding of electrical code requirements
- Risk of creating additional hazards if improperly done
- Proper torque specifications and testing protocols required

## üîµ LOW PRIORITY

### 3. Upgrade Ungrounded Receptacles
- **Priority:** LOW (Safety Enhancement)
- **Location:** Multiple locations throughout building
- **Problem:** Many receptacles are older 2-prong ungrounded outlets that don't provide equipment grounding protection
- **Estimated Cost:** $800 - $1,500

#### **Scope of Work:**
- Assess existing wiring for grounding conductors
- Install new grounded receptacles where ground wire is present
- Install GFCI receptacles where no grounding is available (code-compliant alternative)
- Update receptacles to tamper-resistant models as required by current code
- Test all new installations

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- Proper assessment of existing wiring and grounding
- Code compliance for various installation scenarios
- Electrical permits likely required

### 4. Install AFCI Protection
- **Priority:** LOW (Code Enhancement)
- **Location:** Throughout building per current electrical code
- **Problem:** Building lacks arc-fault circuit interrupter protection required by current electrical codes
- **Estimated Cost:** $600 - $1,200

#### **Scope of Work:**
- Replace standard breakers with combination AFCI breakers
- Test all AFCI breakers for proper operation
- Update panel labeling
- Provide homeowner education on AFCI operation and testing

#### **Required Materials:**
- Combination AFCI circuit breakers (15A and 20A as needed)
- Panel schedule updates

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- Work in main electrical panel
- Proper breaker selection and compatibility
- Testing and verification protocols
- Electrical permit required

### 5. Additional Convenience Receptacles
- **Priority:** LOW (Convenience)
- **Location:** Various locations identified by homeowner
- **Problem:** Insufficient receptacle coverage in some areas
- **Estimated Cost:** $400 - $800

#### **Scope of Work:**
- Install new receptacle circuits as needed
