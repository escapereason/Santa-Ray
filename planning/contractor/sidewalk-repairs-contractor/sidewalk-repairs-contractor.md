## PROVISIONAL CERTIFICATE OPTION

### Alternative Compliance Path
If work cannot be completed before title transfer:

   - **Initial Period:** 120 days to complete repairs
   - **Extensions:** Up to 2 additional 120-day extensions available
   - **Extension Fees:** Full fee applies for each extension

### Recommendation
**Complete repairs before transfer:** Given the 2-3 day timeline, recommend completing actual repairs rather than using provisional certificate to avoid ongoing obligations for new owner.
