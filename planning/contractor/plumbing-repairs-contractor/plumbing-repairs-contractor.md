## 游댮 CRITICAL PRIORITY

### 1. Kitchen Sink Leak
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Active Water Damage)
- **Location:** Lower unit in-law kitchen
- **Problem:** Active leak from the sink plumbing (likely P-trap or supply lines). This is causing water damage to the cabinet and can lead to mold.
- **Estimated Cost:** $200 - $400

#### **Scope of Work:**
- **Emergency assessment** of leak source and severity
- **Immediate water damage mitigation** (shut off water if necessary)
- **Identify root cause:** P-trap, supply lines, shut-off valves, or drain connections
- **Complete repair** with appropriate materials and techniques
- **Test all connections** under full water pressure
- **Inspect surrounding areas** for hidden water damage

#### **Potential Repair Scenarios:**
- **Simple fix:** Tighten loose connections - $200-250
- **Component replacement:** P-trap, supply lines, or shut-off valves - $250-350
- **Complex repair:** Multiple components or access issues - $350-400

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- **Active water damage** requires immediate, reliable repair
- **Potential for complications** if connections are corroded or cross-threaded
- **Risk of making leak worse** with improper repair attempts
- **May require supply line shut-off** and restoration
- **Insurance considerations** for water damage claims

### 2. Loose Toilet
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Structural Damage Risk)
- **Location:** Upper unit hall bathroom
- **Problem:** The toilet is loose at its base, indicating a failed wax ring seal. Every flush can leak water onto the subfloor, leading to rot and fungus damage.
- **Estimated Cost:** $100 - $200

#### **Scope of Work:**
- **Remove toilet** completely from floor flange
- **Inspect subfloor** for water damage, rot, or structural issues
- **Examine flange condition** - repair or replace if damaged
- **Clean old wax ring** completely from flange and toilet base
- **Install new wax ring** with proper sealing
- **Reset toilet** with new bolts and proper alignment
- **Test for leaks** and stability
- **Caulk base** to floor if appropriate

#### **Potential Complications:**
- **Broken flange:** May require subfloor access - add $100-150
- **Subfloor damage:** May require structural repair - add $200-500
- **Toilet damage:** May need replacement - add $200-400

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- **Heavy lifting** and maneuvering of toilet
- **Subfloor assessment** expertise required
- **Proper flange repair** techniques if damaged
- **Risk of sewer gas exposure** during repair
- **Potential for discovering larger structural issues**

## 游리 HIGH PRIORITY

### 3. Incompatible Pipe Connection
- **Priority:** HIGH (Corrosion Prevention)
- **Location:** Subarea, below the upper unit laundry area
- **Problem:** Galvanized steel and copper pipes are connected directly. This causes galvanic corrosion, which will eat away at the pipes and cause a leak.
- **Estimated Cost:** $200 - $400

#### **Scope of Work:**
- **Access confined subarea** safely with proper lighting
- **Assess current connection** and corrosion extent
- **Install dielectric unions** between different pipe materials
- **May require cutting and refitting** pipe sections
- **Test water pressure** throughout system
- **Ensure proper support** for all pipe connections

#### **Required Materials:**
- **Dielectric unions** appropriate for pipe sizes
- **Copper and steel pipe fittings** as needed
- **Flux and solder** for copper connections
- **Pipe thread compound** for steel connections

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- **Confined space work** in cramped subarea
- **Specialized fittings** and installation techniques
- **Soldering and threading** skills required
- **Hidden leaks** could go unnoticed and cause major damage
- **System pressure testing** to ensure integrity

### 4. Improper Water Heater Relief Valve Discharge
- **Priority:** HIGH (Safety Violation)
- **Location:** Upper unit water heater Temperature and Pressure (T&P) relief valve
- **Problem:** The discharge pipe is made of an unapproved material (likely plastic) that could melt or burst under high temperature/pressure, failing to direct scalding water away safely.
- **Estimated Cost:** $150 - $300

#### **Scope of Work:**
- **Remove existing improper discharge pipe**
- **Install code-approved material** (copper or CPVC rated for high temperature)
- **Route pipe properly** to within 6 inches of floor or to approved drain
- **Ensure proper diameter** and no restrictions in flow
- **Test relief valve operation** (may require replacement)
- **Bring installation to current code compliance**

#### **Code Requirements:**
- **Material:** Copper, CPVC, or other approved high-temperature material
- **Diameter:** Same size as relief valve outlet (typically 3/4")
- **Termination:** Within 6" of floor or to indirect drain
- **No threads** in discharge piping
- **No valves or restrictions** in discharge line

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- **Critical safety component** of water heater
- **Code compliance** requirements vary by jurisdiction
- **May require relief valve replacement** during service
- **Potential for scalding water** during testing
- **Permits may be required** for water heater modifications

### 5. Missing Water Heater Drain Pans
- **Priority:** HIGH (Water Damage Prevention)
- **Location:** Both water heaters (upper and lower units)
- **Problem:** Neither water heater has a drain pan installed underneath it. If a slow leak develops, it will directly damage the surrounding structure.
- **Estimated Cost:** $300 - $600

#### **Scope of Work:**
- **Assess space requirements** for drain pan installation
- **May require disconnecting** water heater temporarily
- **Install code-approved drain pan** under each water heater
- **Run drain line** from pan to exterior of building
- **Ensure proper pan sizing** and support
- **Test drain functionality** and proper slope
- **Reconnect all water heater connections**

#### **Installation Challenges:**
- **Limited clearance** around existing water heaters
- **May require lifting** water heaters into position
- **Drilling through exterior walls** for drain lines
- **Routing drain lines** to appropriate termination points
- **Ensuring structural support** for drain pans

#### **Why Professional Required:**
- **Heavy equipment handling** (water heaters)
- **Gas line safety** (if gas water heaters)
- **Electrical safety** (if electric water heaters)
- **Structural penetrations** through building envelope
- **Code compliance** for drain pan sizing and installation
- **Permits likely required** for structural modifications
