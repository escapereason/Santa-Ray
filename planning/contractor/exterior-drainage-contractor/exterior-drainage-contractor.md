## ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY

### 1. Negative Grading Correction
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (Water Intrusion Prevention)
- **Location:** Front and right side of the building foundation.
- **Problem:** The ground slopes towards the building's foundation. This "negative grading" directs rainwater and runoff towards the structure, which can saturate the soil, increase hydrostatic pressure, and lead to water intrusion in the subarea, contributing to the conditions that cause fungus and rot.
- **Estimated Cost:** $500 - $1,200

#### **Scope of Work for Contractor Bid**

**Objective:**
To remediate the negative grading at the front and right side of the building foundation. The goal is to regrade the landscape to establish a positive slope, ensuring surface water flows away from the structure to prevent water intrusion and protect the foundation.

**Detailed Scope:**
1.  **Assessment:** Evaluate the current grade and soil conditions along the front and right side of the house to determine the extent of the negative slope.
2.  **Grading Plan:** Establish a plan to create a consistent positive grade sloping away from the foundation. The standard recommendation is a minimum slope of 6 inches over the first 10 feet (a 5% grade).
3.  **Execution:**
    *   Add, remove, and/or redistribute soil to achieve the planned positive slope.
    *   The soil used should be of appropriate quality (e.g., a clay-loam mix, not sand or gravel) to ensure proper water runoff and minimize erosion.
    *   The final grade must be properly compacted to prevent future settling.
4.  **Integration:** Ensure the new grade integrates seamlessly with existing features such as walkways, driveways, and landscape beds without creating new drainage problems.
5.  **Cleanup:** Remove all excess soil and construction debris from the site upon completion.

**Deliverable:**
A properly graded landscape at the specified locations that effectively directs all surface water away from the building's foundation.
